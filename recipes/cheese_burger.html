    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        A cheeseburger is a hamburger topped with cheese. Traditionally, the slice of cheese is placed on top of the
        meat patty. The cheese is usually added to the cooking hamburger patty shortly before serving. A burger is a
        flat round mass of minced meat or vegetables, which is fried and often eaten in a bread roll

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>2 pounds freshly ground chuck (At least 80% lean)</ol>
    <ol>1 tablespoon onion powder</ol>
    <ol>1 teaspoon salt</ol>
    <ol>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</ol>
    <ol>12 slices deli-counter American cheese</ol>    
    <ol>6 large burger buns, preferably homemade, (toasted if desired)</ol>

    <h2>To Garnish</h2>
    <ol>ketchup</ol> 
    <ol>mayonnaise</ol> 
    <ol>thousand island dressing</ol> 
    <ol>sliced red onion</ol> 
    <ol>sliced tomatoes</ol> 
    <ol>sliced pickles</ol> 
    <ol>fresh lettuce leaves</ol> 

    <h3>The Steps</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, mix ground beef, onion powder, salt and pepper until just combined. Do not overmix, or your patties will be tough.</li>
    <li>Divide into six portions and form patties, without pressing too hard. They should be uniform in thickness. Smooth out any cracks using your fingers. Make these right before you grill them, so they stay at room temperature.</li>
    <li>Preheat your grill, grill pan or cast-iron skillet to high heat and add burger patties. If using a grill, cover with the d.</li>
    <li>Cook until the crust that forms on the bottom of the burger releases it from the pan or grate â€” about 2 minutes. Gently test, but don't fp it until it gets to this point. When burgers ft up easily, fp, add two sces of cheese to each, close d if using a grill, and cook on the other side for another 2-3 minutes for medium to medium rare.</li>
    <li>Remove burgers with a sturdy metal spatula and transfer to a plate. Allow to rest for several minutes, then transfer to buns.</li>
    <li>Garnish as desired and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
